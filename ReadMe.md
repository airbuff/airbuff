# üí´ About Me:
Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üëã<br><br>I am a Computer Science Professional with a diverse background in Networking, Development, and Security. Currently, I am diving back into C programming, refreshing my knowledge of C libraries to ensure that my implementations adhere to secure coding practices. üîí I believe that mastering these fundamentals is crucial for writing robust and secure applications.<br><br>In addition to my focus on C, I am actively engaged in The Odin Project, where I am learning version control. This aspect has proven to be the most fascinating for me so far. Although I haven‚Äôt delved too deeply into the fundamentals yet, I am excited about the potential it holds for streamlining collaboration and enhancing project management in software development. üìä As I progress through the project, I look forward to discovering more about how version control can revolutionize the way I approach coding and teamwork.<br><br>Currently, I am also porting my BlackJack game from Java to C. This project not only allows me to refine my programming skills but also provides a practical application for implementing secure coding principles. üéÆ I am eager to share my progress and insights as I continue this journey.<br><br>Thank you for visiting my profile! Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to collaborate.
